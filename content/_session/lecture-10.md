## Two Goals

1. Flaws in Progressive (Postmodernism) Assumptions
2. Is there external Egyptian evidence that renders these stories historically plausible?

## Flaws in Progressive Assumptions

James K. Hoffmeier, "'These Things Happened' Why a Historical Exodus is Essential for Theology," in _Do Historical Matters Matter to Faith?: A Critical Appraisal of Modern and Postmodern Approaches to Scripture_ (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2012)

### The Exodus and Theology

> The past 30 years have seen radical shifts in how the OT books from Genesis to 1/2 Samuel have been viewed as sources for Israel's history, but hardest hit has been the Egypt and Sinai reports

Israel Finkelstein and Neil Silberman claimed Abraham to Moses is "a brilliant product of the human imagination" ... "is not the way it happened, if it happened at all"

> What's disturbing about this trend is that some who identify themselves as a "new gen of evangelicals" and embrace the label "progressive evangelical" are accepting this revisionist agenda. Kenton Sparks points to the lack of evidence in Egypt for the exodus as reason to embrace the conclusions of critical scholarship that the exodus was not a major event at all

> The 19th century source-critical consensus has completely collapsed in the past 30 years, and today there is little agreement about anything.

> The reality is that historians of the ANE have often accepted the witness of written docs w/o corroborating archaeological data.

- Thutmose II invaded Canaan had no archaeological evidence
- Exodus history is rejected because of the same lack of archaeological evidence

### Postmodern Hermeneutics

> Post modern hermeneutics, the recent rage in many circles, and equally problematic for orthodox readings of Scripture, has had its share of detractors. Jonathan Chaves, of George Washington University, recently offered a devastating critique of postmodern hermeneutics entitled "Soul and Reason in Literary postmodern hermeneutics that cuts to the heart of deconstructionists' agenda.

- Profoundly anti-Christian
- Are Marxists who are no longer satisfied to apply their leftist analysis to the actual world
- Deep, underlying spiritual crisis
- Only return to God will allow a return to sanity in literary criticism
- Why should evangelicals, whether scholars or lay people, want to embrace a "profoundly anti-Christian" approach to reading the Bible?

### Inconsistency of the Approach

- Heiser rejects JEDP (circular reasoning)

## Brad C. Sparks

- 1880 never pursued
- 70+ sources - no one ever compiled them?
