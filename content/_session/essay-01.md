Please select any one of the following four posted readings: (just one)

- Kenneth A. Kitchen, _The Patriarchal Age: Myth or History?_, from the Biblical Archaeology Review
- Ronald S. Hendel, _Finding Historical Memories in the Patriarchal Narratives_, from the Biblical Archaeology Review
- Kenneth A. Kitchen, _The Patriarchs Revisited: A Reply to Dr. Ronald S. Hendel_, from The Near East Archaeological Society Bulletin
- Nahum M. Sarna, _"Abram the Hebrew" 14:13_, from Genesis

The paper will have three sections:

1. Briefly summarize the main point(s) the article is making. (Keep this part concise.)
2. Select two or perhaps three of the arguments / the lines of evidence on which the writer argues for his conclusions; summarize them.
3. Then critique those points. Do you find them convincing, or not? Explain why.

You may refer to more than one of the four posted articles, if it is pertinent to your paper. But your paper will focus on one of those four articles.

## Formatting Requirements

- Again, the papers should be four to five pages in length, double-spaced, with 1" margins.
- Use MS Word, not PDF.
- Use MS Word font size 11 (for Arial), or 12 (for Times New Roman and Calibri).
- You may refer to the page numbers of the article in the body of the paper, as follows:

  "Kitchen critiques a number of points in Hendel's argument (p. 12)."

You do not need to use footnotes; just indicate the page number.

## Grading

- The total points possible based on Dr. Heiser's syllabus was 200. We will retain all of those points, as he set forth.
- Each of the two papers will be worth 50 points; this will raise the point total for the course to 300 points.
