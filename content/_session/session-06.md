## Objectives

- Explains why the notion that only the most literal reading of Genesis 1 is required for good interpretation is flawed.
- Introduces common but flawed ideas relating to the interpretation of Genesis 1.
- Explains how the various ways Genesis 1:1-3 can be interpreted, and how the grammar produces options for answering the contention that Genesis 1 cannot be reconciled with modern cosmology.

## Discussion

The Rational Wiki page “Book of Genesis” includes the following statement:

> Apparently the lights in the sky were also created to act as signs. The idea that the movement, configuration, and appearance of celestial bodies conveyed personal messages was really common in primitive societies. This idea is now generally referred to as astrology, which is forbidden and ridiculed in many other scriptural references. Genesis 1 apparently endorses astrological thinking.

Considering the readings and the lectures, assess the claim. How might it be reworded to be improved? Are there any logical flaws in the claim?
