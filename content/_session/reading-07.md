- Dennis Venema and Darrel Falk, [Deleted: Does Genetics Point to a Single Couple?], from peacefulscience.org
- Peter Enns, Conclusion, from The Evolution of Adam

  NOTE: Enns was (is still?) a defender of Venema's position that there could not have been a historical Adam and Eve. Both are evangelicals, and Venema's is an evolutionary creationist. Enns is in the reformed tradition, so he is among those (the majority) that take Romans 5:12 as teaching original guilt - that the guilt of Adam extends to all humans born thereafter. If you do not have a historical Adam, that idea is impossible, and so Enns concludes "Paul was wrong about Adam but right about Jesus."

- Michael S. Heiser, [The Evolution of Adam: Additional Thoughts], from drmsh.com

  NOTE: Only read the first page, a few paragraphs. The article by Venema that "started it all" was removed from the Biologos website in 2020. You do not need to read the linked items, but the ones by Todd Wood are of special interest since Wood is a young earth creationist who is well versed in genetics. He openly notes that evolution is not a theory in crisis. There is good evidence for it. Wood's PhD is in biology and his dissertation was on a comparison of the chimpanzee and human genomes for sameness ("homology"). Wood's position is basically "I'm going to wait until science and a literal reading of Scripture can be aligned." He is great to read because he is so forthright.
