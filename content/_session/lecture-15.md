## Illustration of the Paradigm

Pre-Mosaic  | Mosaic | NT / eschaton
--- | --- | ---
Gen 1:26-28<br/>Gen 5:1-2 | Women priests?<br/>Exodus 4?<br/>Exodus 19:6? | Rev 1:6

## Slaves?

Pre-Mosaic  | Mosaic | NT / eschaton
--- | --- | ---
Slaves / servants bore sign of covenant (Gen 17) | Included in Exodus 19:6? | Overt: 1 Cor 12:3; Gal 3:28; Col 3:11
"Israelite status" in other ways: ABD | Israelite (yes) | Status as believers
The ger (Milgrom)? | Non-Israelite (no?) | John 1:12; Gal 3:26-29
Genesis? Eden | Social distinction for sure, but covenantal? | Rev 2:26-28; 3:21

## Comparative Slave Laws

- Categories of "slave"
- How much of an overlap?
- Humanitarian or not?
  - (Suggested in required via one specific example): Tsai, p.56 PDF
  - "legal philosophy" ANE vs. HB = (optional Tsai, ch 5)

## Contrasts

### Worldview

- Biblical = human focused
- Cannot explain all the differences or basis for biblical / ANE laws

## Motive ("words") of Lawgiver

- Hammurabi = "concern toward human beings and his contributions of providing protection and justice for his people"
- Biblical =
  1. "Shape peoples' morality and conduct"
  2. "Covenant relationship"
  3. "Reciprocal relationship with God"

## Human Rights in Deuteronomy

### Tsai

- p.16 PDF (gets at reciprocal nature)
- cf. Postell

### How does this relate to slavery?

- Tsai (required), p.45 PDF ("permanent")
- But what about (minority number) chattel slaves? (Mosaic limitation)
