**Does the Bible teach that in the Old Testament, Israelites were saved by obeying the Law?**

You may argue your case from anywhere in the Bible. And please do(!) argue your case from the Bible. Do not write, "I really and truly believe...". Show me what the Scriptures say.

Friendly Hints:

- Ps 32
- Ps 103
- Isaiah 59
- Acts 10
- Romans 3
- The book of Hebrews, esp. ch. 10.
