- Questions are not answers
  - Plant an idea

  > Why was The Gospel of Thomas voted out of the Canon?

- Correlation does not mean causation
  - Ancient Aliens

- Similar does not mean identical

- That you see no explanation doesn't mean there isn't one

  > My lack of omniscience does not mean I need to surrender the point

- Don't assume what you need to prove
  - Make you feel like a moron if you ask for data

- Conclusions aren't islands
  - If that's true, what other things must also be true?
  - What other things must be false?

  > I don't think that the Biblical writers would have interpreted Gen 6 in a supernatural way

  - What about 2 Peter 2? Sinning angels

- "Possible" and "plausible" are not the same
  - Possibilities have to be coherent

- The fact that we can't know _every_thing doesn't mean we can't know _any_thing

  > If I can't know something perfectly I might as well empty my skull&hellip;

  - Extreme thinking &mdash; unlivable existence

- Just because we don't have all the information doesn't mean we have no information, or that what we have is bad information

- A conclusion is only as sound as _all_ of its premises
  - We can still think linear thought
  - Read "The Shallows"
  - 200-300 words
  - Lincoln & Douglass debate (6-7 hours)
  - Absorbed information but cannot process

- A flawed argument in defense of a true proposition isn't sound research or thinking
  - Vulnerabilities will surface

- Don't draw a conclusion that confirms to selected data; a sound conclusion accounts for _all_ the data.

  Outliers in the data are as real as the data you prefer.

  - You have account for it or you cheated
  - Try to win the argument by inundation of data
  - Send it to a field expert?
  - It's good to have people find flaw in your arguments

- Divergent data points can be simultaneously true; they just can't be _mutually_ contradictory.
  - Elohim - polytheism?
  - Explain how it can or can't be

- Primary sources are better than secondary sources (or no sources).
  - Acient people should be allowed to speak for themselves
  - Meaning of the text resides in a reader

- Peer _review_ is better than no review (or echo chamber review).
  - You want to know what you're saying holds up to scrutiny

- Your standards or evidence and coherence need to conform to reality
  - Put it in a real life situation (if you can)

- Mainstream science/scholars would never say that &mdash; so it must be true
  - Deep suspicion

### Look for:
- Data-driven
  - Do they account for things that don't work?
  - Honest with data?
  - Committed falacies?

- Coherent (=conclusions are sound and address outliers)
- Overclaiming
