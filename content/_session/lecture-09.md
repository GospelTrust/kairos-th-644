## Framing Historicity

- Are our modern expectations consistent and reasonable?
  - Egyptians, Mesopotamian accounts include deities, are they not historical?
  - Inconsistency
- How much history would we have?
- Why are we insisting on perfection?
- Is it misguided to judge an ancient document by modern expectations?

## Miller ("Marlarkey")

The key difference between the "two camps" is that...

- Minimalist - Hermeneutic of doubt

Minimalist | Maximalist
--- | ---
maintain that one _cannot_ present an item from the biblical account as history unless that historicity is proven | maintain that one _can_ present an item from the biblical account as history unless that historicity is disproved

## Kitchen vs. Hendel

- Keneth Kitchen, "The Patriarchal Age: Myth or History?"

- Ronald S. Hendel, "Finding historical memories in the patriarchal narratives"
  > In my understanding of the text and the historical facts, the patriarchal narratives of Genesis are a composite of historical memory, traditional folklore and narrative brilliance.

### Kitchen

- Exodus dates
  - Moses 1525
  - Early (Evangelical): 1446 BC (1King 6:1) Solomon reigns in 970 (Assyrian records) + 480 = 1466
  - Late (Kitchen): 1246 BC (Exodus 1) Ramsey

- No direct evidence of Abraham, Isaac, etc...
  - Do the stories correlation places & events. High degree correlation / overall picture work?

- Contexts
  - Price of slaves aligned with the historical prices
  - Typology of treaties
  - Geo-political conditions match Gen 14
  - Patriarchal names (Amorites names) (Ex 16:2)
  - Ancient Narratives (supernatural events)

### Response to Hendel

- Hendel makes a good case for reading the word _ibrm_ here as the patriarchal name Abram, although the so-called minimalists would doubtless prefer a possible alternative, _abbirim_, "stallions," since the Egyptian script would also permit this interpretation
- Hendel - Not extreme minimalist
  - There is a spectrum
- Hendel's problem is that he misunderstands the difference between enactment and formal document
  - Appeals the enactment of the legislation (related not the same thing)
- Geopolitical Conditions
  - The essential point about Gen 14 is that the alliance of four kings of the east is of a nature politically foreign to all periods after ca. 2200 B.C. in Mesopotamia, except one and that one is the period of maximum disunity ca. 2000-1750 BC. This political reality is not considered by Hendel. At that time, Mesopotamia was a patchwork quilt of states and groups.
  - 3rd dynasty of Ur - confusion

Kitchen, none of this proves that everything in the patriarchal period happened the way it written but it shows it could happen

- Difference between digging up Abraham and what he can say from the data

- Argues from the data it is legitimate: everything in the account correlates well to the contexts and not drawn from the bible but from the primary source texts from the period

- What is history?
  - History = "body of Abraham" (is this a reasonable standard?)
  - Akkadian text mentions Abraham but discount the Bible
  - Self-compromising & self-defeating

- Bible told a story that could have happened the way it was told
  - Divine element cannot be proven (must approach from a philosophical viewpoint)
  - Is this reasonable?

### Sarna "Abraham the Hebrew" 14:13

- The designation "Hebrew(s)," _'ivri(m)_ is to be found about thirty times in the Hebrew Bible. It can only derive from an original _'iver_ or _'ever_, and its form permits a connotation that is either geographic or gentilic -- that is, having an ethnic denotation like _kema'ani_, "Canaanite," _mo'abi_, "Moabite."

- "Mamre the Amorite" in 14:13

- "Hebrew" an ethnic or geographic?
  - Ethnic term
  - Distinguish from Egyptians
  - Samson from Philistine

- hapiru are not Hebrews
  - pejorative terms like "gypsies"
