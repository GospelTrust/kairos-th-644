## Jericho &mdash; Archaeological Story

### First major excavation

- Austro-German expedition
- Ernst Sellin & Carl Watzinger
- 1907 - 1909 and again in 1911

### Garstang Excavation, 1930-36

- Excavated a collapsed double city wall
  - late 15th - 14th BC
  - early date Exodus (1400 BC)
  - late date Exodus (1200 BC)
- Excavated a residential area which he believed was part of the city fortified by the double wall
- "City IV" had been destroyed in  a violent fire
  - destroyed about 1400 BCE based on
    - Pottery
    - Scarabs
    - Absence of Mycenaean ware
  - Ascribed the destruction to invading Israelites
  - Controversial even prior to Kenyon

### Kathleen Kenyon, 1952-58

- rigorous stratigraphic excavation techniques
- Concluded Garstang was right about destruction of the double city wall, but wrong on the date
- Dated destruction of City IV to the end of the Middle Bronze Age, about 1550 BC
- Never published a final report before her death

### Meaning

- no strongly fortified LBA city at Jericho for Joshua to conquer when biblical chronology said he arrived there.
- Presumes the late date (LBA) conquest, and so Jericho not destroyed in LBA, so the biblical account is wrong

### Revived Debate in 1990s

- Bryant Wood
- Specialist in Canaanite pottery
- Re-evaluated Kenyon's work

- Heiser
  - 90% of Israel has not been excavated
  - But firm conclusions were made

> In other words, Kenyon’s analysis was based on what was not found at Jericho rather than what was found. According to Kenyon, City IV must have been destroyed at the end of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1550 B.C.E.) because no imported Cypriote ware – diagnostic for the ensuing Late Bronze I period – was found at Jericho.

> Dating habitation levels at Jericho on the absence of exotic imported wares – which were found primarily in tombs in large urban centers – is methodologically unsound and, indeed, unacceptable.

> Other experts find little fault with Wood's archaeology, but they are more skeptical about his linking of the evidence with biblical events.

### Richard S. Hess (late dater)

- Peaceful Infiltration

  > The possibility of foreign groups joining in with Israel on its journeys and after its entrance into the land might be remembered in the references to the Midianites (Numbers 22-25), the Kenites (Judg 4:11; 1 Sam 15:6), the Gibeonites (Joshua 9), and others. Further, there are records of areas of the hill country, such as the region around Shechem, which Israel is portrayed as occupying in the book of Joshua (8:30-35; 24:1, 32), but for which there is no account of conquest.
