## Discussion

The Rational Wiki page “Evidence for the Exodus” cites Israeli archaeologist Ze’ev Herzog as saying:

> The Israelites never were in Egypt. They never came from abroad. This whole chain is broken. It is not a historical one. It is a later legendary reconstruction — made in the seventh century BCE — of a history that never happened.

Considering the readings and the lectures, assess the claim. How might it be reworded to be improved? Are there any logical flaws in the claim?
