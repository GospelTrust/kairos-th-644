Course Dates   | September 2022 - March 2023

## Overview

Refer to the Videos folder for a course introduction by Dr. Heiser.

Thinking well about Scripture also means being able to answer the hard questions posed in the culture and church today. In this course, Dr. Heiser focuses on Old Testament controversies that in today’s conversation provoke criticism of the Bible as a reliable source of spiritual, theological, and historical truth. The goal is to expose how scholarly discussions, as well as amateur discussions (those in the media or online environments), misrepresent these biblical controversial topics

## Objectives

After completing this course, you'll be able to:

- Identify Old Testament controversies that provide contemporary skepticism about the Bible’s veracity.
- Discern the basis of skeptical criticism about controversial biblical topics and how to engage the issues honestly.
- Deconstruct skeptical conclusions about controversial topics and probe for points of incoherence.
- Apply rules for sound thinking to critique skeptical conclusions and formulate coherent alternatives

## Instructional Materials

All instructional material is provided in the course.

<sub>Module 07</sub>
### Historical Adam and Eve

#### Objectives 07

- Explains how current genetic knowledge reinforces evolutionary theory and is used as an assault on the historicity of Adam and Eve.
- Exposes you to the discussion within evangelicalism about the relationship of genetics to the historicity of Adam and Eve.
- Explains how and why some scientists who specialize in genetics embrace a historical Adam and Eve.

#### Pre-work 07

- Read:
  - Dennis Venema and Darrel Falk, [Deleted: Does Genetics Point to a Single Couple?], from peacefulscience.org
  - Peter Enns, Conclusion, from The Evolution of Adam

    NOTE: Enns was (is still?) a defender of Venema's position that there could not have been a historical Adam and Eve. Both are evangelicals, and Venema's is an evolutionary creationist. Enns is in the reformed tradition, so he is among those (the majority) that take Romans 5:12 as teaching original guilt - that the guilt of Adam extends to all humans born thereafter. If you do not have a historical Adam, that idea is impossible, and so Enns concludes "Paul was wrong about Adam but right about Jesus."

  - Michael S. Heiser, [The Evolution of Adam: Additional Thoughts], from drmsh.com

    NOTE: Only read the first page, a few paragraphs. The article by Venema that "started it all" was removed from the Biologos website in 2020. You do not need to read the linked items, but the ones by Todd Wood are of special interest since Wood is a young earth creationist who is well versed in genetics. He openly notes that evolution is not a theory in crisis. There is good evidence for it. Wood's PhD is in biology and his dissertation was on a comparison of the chimpanzee and human genomes for sameness ("homology"). Wood's position is basically "I'm going to wait until science and a literal reading of Scripture can be aligned." He is great to read because he is so forthright.
