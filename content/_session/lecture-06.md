## Falsification?

The notion that it is impossible for gen 1's creation account to be reconciled with modern cosmology.
- Age of the universe; order of "days" and life
- Evolution (in general)

## Apologetic Approaches (General)

## Alternative Textual Strategies

Legitimate for Apologetics and Exegesis because:

- The **text can sustain** alternatives

- Certain YEC points **do not work**
  - Overstating / inaccuracy for meaning of _bara'_ (arguing that Gen 1:1 requires ex nihilo)
  - _y√¥m_ with numeral requires 24 hrs.

    E.g., Gen 8:4; 33:13; Deut 1:2; Judg 20:25; etc.

- Heiser assumptions

  - Modern science is correct (or at least on to something)
  - The biblical writers had an ancient, uniform worldview with respect to natural world
  - God was the point of origin for both natural reality (science) and biblical truth

- Consequently
  - He needs to **affirm** both as true
  - To do so, I need to **discern** what they communicate and what they cannot claim (or what they over-claim)
  - I also need to **be mindful** of the providential view of inspiration (vs. traditional dictation or "mental telepathy"): distinguish truth propositions from means of expressing those propositions

## Responding to Falsification

**While the biblical text affirms** a Creator-creation distinction, which requires God to be the Creator of all things visible and invisible (Col 1:16; 1Cor 8:6; Rom 11:36; Heb 1:2; 11:3 &mdash; cp. Ps 33:6, 9 [LXX 32:6, 9])

...**the text does not require** that 1:1-3 be confined to 24-hr cycles. **The time can be undefined**.

## Issues in Gen 1:1-3 &mdash; _beresit_

- Tanakh - When God began to create heaven and earth &mdash; the earth being unformed and void, with darkness over the surface of the deep and a wind from God sweeping over...

- Examples has a temporal _beresit_

- Possibility of indefinite beginning
- _vav_ + noun + verb: "Now the earth was formless..." (NIV)

## Options and Implications

Gen 1:1 as **independent** clause

- Functions as a title because it is disconnected in sequence from 1:2 because of _waw_.
- Gen 1:1 essentially a heading
- Gen 1:2 sets the opening circumstance; 1:3 begins the description of God's work (first creative act)

God created, now He's reordering the stuff...

- Don't necessarily requires a definite beginning
- Don't necessarily requires a 24-hour
- Inhabitable for human
