## Terminology

- Apodictic Law: absolute commands ("thou shalt not")
- Casuistic Law: case studies / scenarios
- Lex talionis: retributive ("in kind") justice

## Issue: Literary Relationship to ANE Law Codes

- Many similarities
- Many differences
- Many law codes which could serve as analogies or sources

- Required reading illustrates the above
- Optional reading (Wright) presents a new (controversial in scholarship) approach approximating the sort of claims you'd hear outside academia

## Sarna

- Torah followed long-established, widespread, standardized patterns of Mesopotamian law
- ANE: Everyone had law codes
- Love covenant is unique

## Wright

- Copied from the Hammurabi
- During the 8 century

## Rebuttal Against Wright

- If copied, why lots of things are left out?
- There are better parallels but Wright wanted to prove the wholesale copy proposition
- Covenant Code are found in lots of other places

## Issue: God's Love Unique to Law Covenant

### Moran (1963)

- Covenantal love = obedience of vassal

  1. Relationship absent of love in God's direction
  2. No specific parental metaphor
  3. Love could therefore be _commanded_

- One-sided view (even in DOTP); first two points found in other biblical texts but not Deuteronomy
  - Sees Hosea 11:1 (Osee), but **misses** Deut 7:7-8 because focused on _'ahab_ ('aheb, 'ahaba)

### McCarthy

- Disagreed with Moran that there was no father-son love metaphor in Deuteronomy
- Agreed that this parental relationship was basically one directional, lacking emotional element on God's part

### Lapsley (2009)

- Some needed push back in both respects
- Consider other terminologies allows for emotions in love
- Moran did not consider other words
- Deut 7:7-8 Israel's election depends on God's freely given love, the logic of which cannot be fully understood
- Hammurabi doesn't have covenant love relationship with his people
- God's love for **humanity** (unique)

<hr class='section' />

- Important to biblical theology
- Scholars are not warm to the notion that the laws were copied wholesale from the source
- Find parallel in other texts
