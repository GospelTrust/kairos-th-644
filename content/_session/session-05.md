## Objectives

- Explains why the notion that the writer of Genesis stole the flood story is simplistic and ignorant of the differences in the story and its intentional artistry.
- Explains how certain features of the Genesis story might be communicating theological polemic to the original audience and might artificially produce the source divisions presumed to be behind Genesis 6-9.
